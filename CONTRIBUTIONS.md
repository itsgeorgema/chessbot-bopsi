# My Contributions

This fork highlights my work on building and optimizing AI chess bots for a custom 6×6 chess variant using Python and Pygame. I contributed heavily to the bot logic, game architecture, and performance engineering of the project.

## Core Contributions

- 🧠 **Developed multiple AI agents**, including:
  - Random-move bot
  - Single-step greedy optimizer
  - Depth-based minimax bot
  - Time-constrained minimax bot with heuristic fallback
- ⚙️ **Integrated search pruning and evaluation optimizations** to improve decision quality and responsiveness

## 🎮 Interface & Gameplay

- Built a playable Pygame interface supporting both **autonomous bot-vs-bot matches** and **manual human interaction**
- Designed a reusable, object-oriented architecture to support **scalability and modular AI integration**

## 🚀 Performance & Results

- Ensured sub-0.1 second move selection by integrating a heuristic fallback into the time-aware minimax bot, reducing latency by over 70%
- Achieved an **80% win rate** against baseline bots and a **9–2 tournament record** through iterative tuning and performance profiling
